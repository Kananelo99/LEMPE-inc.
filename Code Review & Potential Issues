In project_4d_to_3d, you compute:

w = 1 / (distance - point[3])

This could potentially raise a ZeroDivisionError or make the projection wildly unstable if point[3] gets close to distance (which is 3). If the point's w-coordinate reaches 3, the denominator becomes 0.

✅ Fix: Clamp or guard against that:

denominator = distance - point[3]
if abs(denominator) < 1e-5:
    denominator = 1e-5  # or skip the point entirely
w = 1 / denominator

2. Perspective Distortion in project_3d_to_2d

You do:

factor = fov / (fov + point[2])

If point[2] becomes negative or large, the projection may go offscreen or flip the image.

✅ Suggestion: Clamp or handle z-depth limits, e.g.:

if point[2] < -fov + 1:
    point[2] = -fov + 1

3. Rotation Consistency

Your rotation function mutates the vector like this:

return vec @ mat

But this can yield unexpected results unless vec is row-vector shaped. It's safer to transpose or use matrix multiplication directly with reshaped vectors:

✅ Safer multiplication:

return np.dot(mat, vec)

🛠️ Optional Improvements

Smooth rotation with multiple axes: Add rotate_4d(v, angle, i, j) for other pairs too (like 1,3 or 2,3) for richer dynamics.

Camera controls: Add keys to modify angle or rotation planes.

Edge coloring: Color-code based on depth or axis of rotation for clarity.

Labeling or tooltips: Number vertices for educational demos.

🧪 Minimal Fix Patch Example

Update project_4d_to_3d:

def project_4d_to_3d(point, distance=3):
    denominator = distance - point[3]
    if abs(denominator) < 1e-5:
        denominator = 1e-5
    w = 1 / denominator
    projection_matrix = np.array([
        [w, 0, 0],
        [0, w, 0],
        [0, 0, w]
    ])
    return projection_matrix @ point[:3]

Update rotate_4d:

def rotate_4d(vec, angle, i, j):
    mat = np.identity(4)
    c, s = math.cos(angle), math.sin(angle)
    mat[i, i] = c
    mat[i, j] = -s
    mat[j, i] = s
    mat[j, j] = c
    return np.dot(mat, vec)
